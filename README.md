## Hi there 👋

Professional background in full stack web development (Javascript, Typescript) using popular front-end frameworks like Vue (2.x) and Angular (17/18). I did some cross-platform mobile development too using Cordova / Ionic. I've got experience with Node for the back-end.

📚 I'm willing to focus on learning DevOps ways and best practices. Messing with Python and Go !

👉🏻 Here my [WIP blog / portfolio website](https://ram-4.github.io/astro-nano-me/) built with Astro 🚀
