## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Professional background in full stack web development (Javascript, Typescript) using popular front-end frameworks like Vue (2.x) and Angular (17/18). I've got experience with Node for the back-end. Will do a more exhaustive list later.

- ðŸ“š I'm willing to focus on learning DevOps tools and best practices. For now I am messing with Python !
